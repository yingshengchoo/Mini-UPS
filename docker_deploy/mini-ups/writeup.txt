Our system stands out by offering advanced logistics and customer-focused features to create a faster,
more flexible, and transparent delivery experience. For truck distribution, we use a FIFO algorithm to
ensure users receive their packages as quickly as possible. If no trucks are available at the time of
request, the system automatically assigns a truck once one becomes free, ensuring a seamless experience
without requiring user intervention. Additionally, users can prioritize important packages, allowing
critical deliveries to be processed and delivered faster. We also implemented a shareable tracking link,
enabling users to easily share package information with others by simply providing them with the link.

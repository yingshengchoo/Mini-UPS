Our system stands out by offering advanced logistics and customer-focused features to create a faster,
more flexible, and transparent delivery experience. For truck distribution, we use a FIFO algorithm to
ensure users receive their packages as quickly as possible. If no trucks are available at the time of
request, the system automatically assigns a truck once one becomes free, ensuring a seamless experience
without requiring user intervention. Additionally, users can prioritize important packages, allowing
critical deliveries to be processed and delivered faster. We also implemented a shareable tracking link,
enabling users to easily share package information with others by simply providing them with the link.
可以說一下 cookies?
BUG:
登不出去... 可能跟cookie 有關,  很相似:登入後 compose down + compose up 一樣會在logged in state/ 就算直接到 .../login/login.html 登入別的用戶也沒用
copy link --> 新的有覽器 會顯示Your packages 在沒有登入的情況

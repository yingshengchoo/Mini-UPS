Our system stands out by offering advanced logistics and customer-focused features to create a faster,
more flexible, and transparent delivery experience.

- **Truck Distribution**:
  We use a **FIFO algorithm** to ensure users receive their packages as quickly as possible.
  If no trucks are available at the time of request, the system **automatically assigns a truck** once one becomes free, ensuring a seamless experience without requiring user intervention.

- **Package Prioritization**:
  Users can **prioritize important packages**, allowing critical deliveries to be processed and delivered faster.

- **Shareable Tracking Links**:
  We implemented a **shareable tracking link**, enabling users to easily share package information with others by simply providing them with the link.
